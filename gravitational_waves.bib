  Tidal disruption around NS-NS merger leads to EM signal.
  Observables
  - Neutron-rich ejecta observed in optical and near-IR ("kilonova"), decays quickly in ~10 days
  - Wide-angle outflow ("afterglow") in radio
  Controversy between scenarios: successful jet (unshocked jet core) + cocoon (shocked ejecta and jet) (="structured jet") vs. choked jet + cocoon
  Resolved with VLBI, which gave tight constraint on jet opening angle.
  Late-time afterglow can help probe velocity profile of total mass, giving tight constraints on NS equations of state.
