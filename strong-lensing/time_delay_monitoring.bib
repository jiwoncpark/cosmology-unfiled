  - Look for an ALMA image for a good illustration of multiply-imaged quasars! 
  - There's apparently also an error budget table on the H0 measurement. 
  - Multiband information will help to constrain microlensing. 
  - Read up on lens RXJ1131-1231. 
  - The old monitoring strategy used a 1m class telescope, a Swiss 1.2m Euler telescope in La Silla, and a AZT-22, a 1.5m telescope in Mt. Maidanak Observatory, Uzbekistan. An upcoming new monitoring strategy will use 2m telescope (MPIA, VST, and VATT) and features a daily cadence and mmag photometric precision that can reach desired levels of precision in just 1 season. 
  - Euler has approx. 25 targets, the time delays of which 14 are measured, of which 5 are good for cosmography. The 2.2m (VST?) has 10-11 targets, the time delays of which 6 are measured, of which 4 are good for cosmography. We can query ground-based data, e.g. DES, for the worse targets.
  - There are many doubles being wasted!
  - VST will be used for LSST follow-up. 
  - We can look forward to obtaining time delays for 30-50 lenses soon. 
  - 15 years of observation data release is planned.}
