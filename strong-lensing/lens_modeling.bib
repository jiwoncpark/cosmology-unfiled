  10" is good for postage stamp, works for DES0408-5534.
  In slides, pasting images in order from high redshift to low with low in the foreground is good!
  - Overlay H0 histograms for different models
  - 3 times as many doubles as quads
  - Automating the lens modeling flowchart (decision tree)
  - Vedant Sahu (UCLA undergrad), working on object detection network that identifies and classifies each component type
  - Spatially resolved kinematics makes contour tighter by factor of 2.
  - surface density, deflection angle, potential. Elliptical mass profiles are analytically difficult for lensing. Workaround starts with elliptical potential, but this often yields nonsensical surface density for low axis ratios.
  - Elliptical Gaussian mixture is more general and efficient; can plug into Jeans anisotropic modeling of kinematics. This enables unified lensing and kinematics analysis. 
  - External convergence estimate E. Buckley-Geer (Fermilab), Rusu (NAOJ)
  - Kinematics of deflector Lin (Fermilab)
  - Simulations already assume a cosmology, a problem for LOS summary statistics.

  - A signal (1D, 2D) is "sparse" if it's defined by very few coefficients in a given basis. For example, non-periodic, multiscale signals are sparse in wavelet space.
  - Wavelet decomposition used for denoising. The choice of threshold to apply is a tricky one, as it can remove small substructures.
  - Denoising and decomposing is equivalent to regularization on the pixels.
  - Each galaxy (lens and source) is sparser in its own plane (in wavelets space).
  - Future work pending for Aymeric:
  1. Spectral information through multiband imaging (better lens/source deblending and faster algorithm)
  2. Fully sparse modeling, i.e. SLIT applied to lens mass as well as lens, source light. This will improve stellar/DM substructures studies. 
  - Anowar and Tommaso at UCLA have focused on real data whereas Martin and Aymeric at EPFL have focused on simulations. They plan to merge their codebases so that they can learn from one another's results.
  - Velocity dispersion can be used as a model rejection criterion as well.
