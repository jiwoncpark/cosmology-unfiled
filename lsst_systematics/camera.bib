  note={
  Flat fielding is dividing by raw image by flat-field image.
  Express CCD systematics, e.g. tree rings, random pixel size variation, edge effects, lithographic errors, in pixel area distortions
  Take coadded flat-field images to get the superposition of all electrostatic sensor effects. Used function that's only sensitive to E-modes, since B-modes don't exist (curl is zero).
  For LSST, distortions are 0.08 mmag, 1.2 mas, 1.e-8, 1e-10 in 2-pt amplitudes for e1 and e2 assuming 0.7" PSF.
  But study assumes PRNU (pixel response non-uniformity) of 0.4%, whereas LSST sensors may have PRNU of 4%.
