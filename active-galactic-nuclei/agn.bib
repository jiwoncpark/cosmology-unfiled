  note={Presented by Hui Li 10/31/19. In the jet, helical magnetic fields become chaotic and lead to shock. binding energy of SMBH ~ 10^62 ergs for 10^8 solar masses. "Magnetic tower" (Lynden-Bell 2003), current down the jet ~ 10^17 A with toroidal magnetic field component that that loops around the far-side lobe and returns. We didn't know current was that strong that far down the jet! Studies using hydrodynamic jet (no current) vs. magnetic tower jet (global current). Testable features of magnetic tower model are hydro shock detached from the lobes (far in the background), formation of "round" lobe at the core radius, and size of lobe determined by jet current and bg pressure. Farther away the cluster, the bigger the lobe (even after selection effects). Edge formed by return current can be very sharp; magnetic field can drop exponentially to zero. Tower jets can survive in wind (evolve into perpendicular, self-protective) whereas hydro jets can. One consequence of global current is kink instability that produces flares, which are consistent with optical polarization studies. Particle acceleration driven by magnetic dissipation can produce power-laws. UHECR=ultra high-energy cosmic ray.},
