  note={Presented by Hui Li 10/31/19. In the jet, helical magnetic fields become chaotic and lead to shock. binding energy of SMBH ~ 10^62 ergs for 10^8 solar masses. "Magnetic tower" (Lynden-Bell 2003), current down the jet ~ 10^17 A with toroidal magnetic field component that that loops around the far-side lobe and returns. We didn't know current was that strong that far down the jet! Studies using hydrodynamic jet (no current) vs. magnetic tower jet (global current). Testable features of magnetic tower model are hydro shock detached from the lobes (far in the background), formation of "round" lobe at the core radius, and size of lobe determined by jet current and bg pressure. Farther away the cluster, the bigger the lobe (even after selection effects). Edge formed by return current can be very sharp; magnetic field can drop exponentially to zero. Tower jets can survive in wind (evolve into perpendicular, self-protective) whereas hydro jets can. One consequence of global current is kink instability that produces flares, which are consistent with optical polarization studies. Particle acceleration driven by magnetic dissipation can produce power-laws. UHECR=ultra high-energy cosmic ray.},

  note={
  Star formation rate density vs. age of universe and BH mass vs. stellar velocity dispersion are evidence that black holes and galaxies coevolve.
  AGN clustering depends on cosmology, governing how halos cluster, and galaxy/AGN formation and evolution, which determine how AGN occupy their host DM halos.
  Independent of redshift, M_halo seems to fall under group environments.
  Selection effects are severe. X-ray subject to luminosity cuts, optical/IR subject to spectral/color cuts.
  Focused on hard X-ray-selected AGN because of obscuration in other wavelengths.
  Hickox & Alexander 2018 has a plot of the effect of intrinsic spectrum vs. observed spectrum.
  Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS, Koss et al 2017) computed the correlation function at z=0 after combining AGN sample with 2MASS galaxies. 
  Questions:
  1. Do AGN reside in special cosmic environments?
  Empirical halo model required to connect DM with galaxy distributions. Used Behroozi 2013 relation between M_halo vs. stellar mass.
  Found that AGN cluster like inactive galaxies of the same stellar mass. No special environments for BH accretion. It's just a stochastic process triggered by internal galaxy processes rather than environmental processes like mergers.
  2. Dependence on obscuration?
  Dusty torus surrounding accretion disk. Previous studies don't agree on clustering statistics between obscured (type 2) or unobscured (type 1). Need to match luminosity, redshift, and stellar mass which matches SFR. Obscured AGN are more clustered and live in denser environments.
  Obscuration can come from dusty torus or host galaxy.
  Unobscured AGN preferred younger, less concentrated halos. 
  After accretion phase, AGN likely to have thinner torus and unobscured.
  Speculation: assembly history is responsible? If there is a recent, rapid halo mass accretion event, it reduces the amount of circumnuclear obscuring material.
  Most luminous AGN are selected from optical surveys. Moderate AGN from X-ray surveys.
  Combined X-ray luminous quasars = S82 + XMM-XXL-north
  Selection biases are driving discrepancy between optical vs. X-ray AGN rather than luminosity differences. No evidence for luminosity-dependent clustering.
  She focused on ratio-quiet AGN. Radio-loud AGN tend to reside in more massive environments, so worth repeating this study including them.
